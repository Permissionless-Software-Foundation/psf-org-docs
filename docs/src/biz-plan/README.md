# Introduction

This website contains the organizational documents for the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.cash) (PSF). This is a living document, which is intended to be regularly updated by it's membership through GitHub Pull Requests. These documents are managed and evolved in the same way as the rest of the open source code that PSF maintains.

## Our Mission

The mission of the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.cash) (PSF) is to develop, promote, and maintain software that makes it easy for **individuals** to protect their _privacy_, _circumvent censorship_, and _engage in economic activity_.

## What Is the PSF?

The PSF is a consortium of cryptocurrency-focused businesses. Our model is similar to the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/join/members/). The purpose of the organization is to find ways to sustainably fund the development and maintenance of open source infrastructure. Infrastructure that the businesses collectively depend on.

The PSF is not an engineering-for-hire-company. It's a consortium of businesses with common interests. It's more of a social club with a purpose, then it is a business. That purpose is finding ways to sustainably fund the development and maintenance of infrastructure. Infrastructure that all the businesses in the consortium need, in order to conduct their business.

The PSF is not exclusively a foundation, a company, or a community, but it embodies aspects of all three. It does not restrict itself to a single blockchain or a single country. It does not have any legal or official existence, it does not use fiat, but it does maintain its own cryptocurrency assets. The PSF is a form of [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization).

PSF members hold PSF tokens in order to participate in governance and access token-only services. It's an open network that anyone is free to join or leave. The amount of influence an individual has over the organization is determined by the quantity of PSF tokens they own, and the length of time they've owned them.
